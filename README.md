README for Olam Autoresponder Update 2024

Olam Autoresponder is a sequential autoreponder used for sending out lessons, ebooks and so on. 
It would be good if it could also send out MP3 files under 25MB via email. 

1. Check code for compatibility with latest versions of PHP
2. Check security
3. Look at how to add avrious kinds of attachments easily. At the moment I think it accepts PDF, I am not sure about MP3
4. Talk with my tech guy Bob Farrington about adding features, he is the other collaborator. For instance, chceking on open rate, and anything to help it conform to standards for sending emails out. 
5. Compare with the old code in the Olam 2021 respository and integrate anything useful.
